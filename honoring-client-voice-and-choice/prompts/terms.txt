Relationship-Building
If conducting outreach, offer a sustaining resource (food, socks, sleeping bag, etc.) Introduce yourself after asking for their name, REPEAT their name before you give yours. © Repeat their name often to improve recall Keep initial dialog short and to the point until it’s clear they are comfortable talking with you Compliment something sensory, tie it to a common interest, and an open-ended question o “That's an awesome shirt, | love Metallica! Did you get that at a concert?" o “Your dog is really well behaved, mine would be miles away by now. Did you train her to stay like that?” Instead of starting over, ask them to introduce you to someone they know nearby that also could use the sustaining resource you are distributing. Build trust through consistent presence, active listening, and non-coercive support.

# Person-centered Planning

Once a client is enrolled, Case Managers must intake the client. The intake form provides us with a holistic snapshot of the client, their circumstances, their potential challenges, their strengths and their preferences. Once the intake form is completed, a Stability plan will be generated automatically and placed in the clients shared folder in google drive. Case Managers are responsible for reviewing these plans for accuracy.
© Do not filter, revise, or challenge stated preferences (“no reality-checking”). Intakes must be completed every six months, generating new stability plans each time
e Stability plans should be updated more regularly, based on client feedback or if they experience a change in their circumstances.

# Providing Service Choice

e All services are voluntary. This fosters trust, avoids coercion, and centers agency.
Clients choose who they want to engage with and what, when, and how services are delivered. No prerequisites or participation is required, such as psychiatric or substance use treatment. Housing and services are never used as leverage to enforce treatment compliance or behavioral expectations.

# Providing Housing Choice

e Introduce the Affordable Housing & Shelter Locator and walk clients through available listings.
© Provide time and space for clients to decide without pressure.
© Avoid steering clients toward units based on system availability or personal bias. e Offer to schedule and accompany clients on housing tours.

# Prioritizing Preference

e |tis important to honor a clients preferences whenever possible, advocating and negotiating for it when necessary.
© Aclient is self-advocating whenever they share a preference for or against something with you. © Compromising client preferences should only occur when no other option is available and must be explained as such. e Clients have the right to wait for options that suit their preferences without losing their priority or placement with us. ° If aclient shares that their preferences are not being respected by another provider, report this to the KCRHA Ombuds Office.
