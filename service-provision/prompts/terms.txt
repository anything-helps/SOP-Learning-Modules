Definitions
Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH): A service model designed for individuals who cannot succeed in housing without services and who cannot succeed in services without housing. PSH aims to promote stability and independence in community-integrated settings.
HUD-Defined Permanent Supportive Housing (HUD-PSH): Housing that combines non-time-limited financial support with voluntary supportive services, intended for individuals with disabilities and those experiencing chronic homelessness. The focus is long-term stability, not transitional care.
Foundational Community Supports (FCS): A Medicaid-funded program offering tenancy support and supported employment services to individuals with complex needs, enabling housing retention through flexible, trauma-informed case management.
Governor's Opportunity for Supportive Housing (GOSH): A state-funded initiative that bridges services for individuals exiting institutions or homelessness, with a focus on intensive tenancy support, behavioral health coordination, and community reintegration.
Individual Placement and Support (IPS): An evidence-based model of supported employment that emphasizes rapid job search, client preference, and integrated behavioral health services to help individuals achieve their employment goals.

# Our Service Model

Anything Helps delivers a client-centered, trauma-informed model of care that blends the strengths of Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH) and Individual Placement and Support (IPS). We believe that each person is the expert in their own life, and we support them in defining and pursuing their own goals across housing, health, income, and social connection. Our services are grounded in strong, trusting relationships. Staff provide consistent, flexible, and long-term support that follows the client's pace and preferences. Rather than handing people off between systems, we walk alongside them—offering stability, coordination, and advocacy across every part of their journey.

# Programmatic Principles:

Our low-barrier, community-based model of care is built on seven core principles:

# 1. Listening: We Recognize That Each Client Is The Expert In Their Own Life. Clients Set Their Own Goals And Drive Their Journey, While Our

staff rides in the "passenger seat", offering support and advice but never taking the wheel. This client-driven approach respects individual autonomy and lived experience. By empowering people to make their own choices, we build trust through empowerment and honor their personal agency.

# 2. Accomodating: We Make Our Services As Accessible As Possible, Meeting People Where They're At Without Judgment Or Unnecessary

requirements. This low-barrier approach means there are no arbitrary hoops to jump through. Help is available without preconditions like sobriety or program compliance. Staff act as negotiators and collaborators, finding out what each person is
willing to try and what they are most likely to succeed with. By starting with what the client is ready to accept, we reduce harm and gradually build trust, creating a foundation for deeper engagement over time.

# 3. Integrative: We Focus On Placing And Supporting People In Healthy Community Settings, Not In Segregated Ones. Stability Is

reinforced by surrounding clients with opportunities and positive peer influences. Whether it's housing or work in a normal neighborhood or involvement in community activities, community is key to long-term success. It provides a sense of belonging, purpose, and meaning and fosters environments where people can adopt healthy routines and reduce opportunities for harm.

# 4. Consistent: Our Support Is Relationship-driven And Continuous Across Different Systems. We Don't "hand Off" Clients And Walk Away

when another provider gets involved. Instead, we stay with them and coordinate with external partners to share the workload. This continuity means clients don't have to retell their stories or worry about being left on their own. By remaining a consistent presence, we reduce the burden on the individual and ensure no one falls through the cracks as they move toward stability.

# 5. Flexible: All Services And Supports We Offer Are Voluntary, And We Never Coerce Participation. Because We Invest In Strong, Trusting

relationships, clients engage with services on their own terms. We might encourage and suggest options (like counseling, treatment, or job training), but the decision is always left to the client. This approach ensures that help is client-directed and non-judgmental. It respects each person's readiness and choice, which in turn makes them more likely to stick with the services they choose.

# 6. Long-term: Housing And Employment Are Essential Tools, But They Are Not The Finish Line. True Success Is Defined By The Client's Own

sense of stability and well-being. We don't consider our job done the moment someone gets an apartment or a job placement. Instead, we continue to provide support until that person feels securely established and self-sufficient. In line with PSH and IPS principles, housing and work are means to an end, not ends in themselves. Our ultimate goal is that each individual achieves lasting stability in their life, and we remain available as long as needed to help reach that point.

# 7. Hopeful: We Show Up For People Fully, Both Physically And Emotionally, Meeting Them "all The Way" Rather Than Just Halfway. This

means going out to where clients are, understanding their reality, and standing alongside them through challenges. We embrace an abundance mindset in our work, proactively countering the scarcity mentality that often comes with homelessness and overstretched services. Instead of thinking in terms of limited resources or time, we choose to believe there is enough care and opportunity for everyone. By being fully present and generous with our support, we help clients move past fear and scarcity, reinforcing the belief that they deserve stability and that we'll go the distance with them.

# Integration With Systems Of Care

Anything Helps ensures that supportive housing services are fully integrated with public behavioral health, legal, and healthcare systems. Staff engage in regular case conferencing with system partners and maintain updated release of information (ROI) forms to enable holistic coordination.

# Community-based Service Philosophy

Services are delivered wherever clients are—in the home, community, shelters, or on the street. We maintain a field-based model with flexible schedules and modes of engagement. Staff are trained in harm reduction, motivational interviewing, and culturally responsive care. Relationships are the foundation of engagement; we meet people where they are, both physically and emotionally, and maintain consistency through rapport, honesty, and follow-through.

# Clarifying Misconceptions

PSH is not a building or facility; it is a service model. Anything Helps educates clients, partners, and community members about the distinction between PSH as a philosophy versus a physical place. This prevents institutional drift and reinforces our commitment to community-based recovery environments.

# Quality Assurance And Fidelity Monitoring

We monitor our alignment with PSH principles through quarterly fidelity self-assessments, client satisfaction surveys, and peer chart reviews. All direct service staff are trained annually in PSH principles. Program improvements are made in response to feedback, fidelity data, and outcome tracking.
