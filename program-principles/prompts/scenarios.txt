# Program Principals


# 1. Honoring Client Voice & Choice

We center each client's own goals, values, and self-defined priorities. Services are guided by what matters most to the people we serve, not by rigid program designs or external expectations. We provide information clearly, offer real choices without coercion, and honor the dignity of each decisionâ€”even when it's different from what we might choose ourselves.

# 2. Community As Client

    TASK: Create scenario-based questions JSON:
    {
      "scenarios": [
        {
          "id":"s_001",
          "title":"Short scenario title",
          "description":"1-2 sentence realistic situation",
          "question":"What should staff do?",
          "options":{"A":"...","B":"...","C":"...","D":"..."},
          "correct":"A|B|C|D",
          "explanation":"One-sentence justification from source",
          "relatedConcepts":["..."],
          "difficulty":"easy|medium|hard"
        }
      ]
    }
    RULES:
    - Create up to 6 scenarios.
    - Situations should match the spirit and constraints of the source.
    - Output JSON only. No extra commentary.
