Program Principals

1. Honoring Client Voice & Choice

We center each client's own goals, values, and self-defined priorities. Services are guided by what matters most to the people we serve,
not by rigid program designs or external expectations. We provide information clearly, offer real choices without coercion, and honor the
dignity of each decisionâ€”even when it's different from what we might choose ourselves.

2. Community as Client
