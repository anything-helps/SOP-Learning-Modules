Procedures

Receiving Cash

e The person who handles cash is not the same person who
does record-keeping, ensuring proper separation of duties.
A maximum amount of cash on hand is kept in a secure
location with a cash box ledger, and petty cash is counted
and reconciled monthly.

e Cash received is always counted and recorded with initials
by at least two people to ensure accuracy and
accountability. Checks received are immediately endorsed
with a restrictive “for deposit only” stamp and recorded ona
daily receipt record with copies of the checks attached.

¢ Credit card receipts have authorized approvals or signatures
and are batched daily for accurate tracking. All cash and
checks received are deposited daily to minimize the risk of
loss or theft.

Spending Cash

e The person who writes checks and pays bills does not have
the authority to sign checks, ensuring a separation of duties
for financial security. Additionally, the person who approves
purchases is not the same person who pays the bills,
maintaining further checks and balances. All purchases must
be within budget or approved by a vote of the board of
directors.
e Payroll checks are compared with employee records to verify
accuracy. All signed checks must have a matching check
stub with supporting approved documents attached, and
checks issued for large amounts over a predetermined level
require two signatures for added security.

e Signing blank checks is not allowed, and all checks are
prenumbered with the organization's information printed at
the top. All signed checks are issued to a verified business
vendor or employee reimbursement to ensure legitimacy.

¢ Online payments, credit card purchases, and petty cash
payments follow the same procedures and approvals as
paper checks, maintaining consistent oversight across all
payment methods.

Review and Monitoring

e The Money Management Policy will be reviewed annually by
the Board of Directors to ensure its effectiveness and
compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.
