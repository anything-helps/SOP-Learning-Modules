If any category is running above 50 percent by mid-month, freeze discretionary items until month-end. . Revisit after Housing Hope invoice cycle When the first Housing Hope revenues clear (expected mid-June), confirm that the $34,670 income target is realistic. If revenue settles higher, direct the surplus to rebuilding a 60-day cash reserve. . Keep personal expenses at zero Personal draws were a one-off relocation cost. Continue the card lock-out and capture any incidental items under the proper category (travel, office, or program). .
