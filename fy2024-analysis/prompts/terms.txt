# Income Trends

Anything Helps’ monthly income grew significantly over FY2024. Total income ranged from a low of ~$2,682 in April 2024 up to ~$40,526 in March 2025, a dramatic increase. This growth was driven primarily by FCS Service Revenue, which climbed to about $40K by March 2025. Grants this year were infrequent but substantial (totaling $52,500 for the year) — the most notable of which were the 25k Commerce Capacity-Building Grant and the Awards we received in November 2024 ($10K), and December 2024 ($17.5K) from the proposals written by Renee Kuhl in September ($5.5k cost). Donations provided a smaller, steady stream (about $11,309 total for the year, averaging ~$943 monthly), with a notable spike in August 2024
(~$4.3K) which reflected a donation from Mark Garrett, our Board Chair. Overall, total income averaged ~$18.7K per month across the last 12 months, with the biggest peaks corresponding to grant receipts and surges in program/service revenue.

# Expense Trends

Monthly expenses also rose significantly through the year, more-or-less following the growth in income. Total expenses ranged from about $4,045 in April 2024 to $34,583 in March 2025. Expenses climbed into the $20K-$30K range in late 2024 and early 2025 as programs expanded and investments in staffing and infrastructure increased. The largest cost drivers were staffing and program delivery — employee payroll and contractor fees together made up the bulk of expenses. There were a few months with anomalously high or unusual costs (for example, an unusually large Personal Expenses amount in June 2024 related to Mike’s relocation), but overall most expense categories showed relatively consistent recurring levels in line with ongoing operations.

# Recurring Monthly Expenses

Employee and contractor costs together accounted for roughly 70%+ of total expenses in an average month. In FY2024, these two personnel-related areas combined averaged about $12.9K of the ~$17.6K in total monthly expenses. Program expenses and office/admin costs were the next largest recurring outflows, while travel, marketing, and other expenses were relatively small by comparison. It’s important to recognize that these average monthly amounts are in no way predictive or usable in forecasting. Beneath these numbers lies extreme volatility and unpredictability.
enses led to irregular monthly cash flows. Several months hen spending outpaced income — for example, July 2024 had Employee Salaries & Wages (incl. payroll taxes) $7,445 an operating cash outflow around -$9,153, and October 2024 around -$11,276 - coinciding with periods of high program activity and investment) without equivalent income influx in those specific months. Conversely, cash surpluses occurred in months
Contractor Salaries & Wages $5,477 with large funding receipts — for instance, September 2024 saw a +$12,008 net operating cash inflow (driven largely by grants that month), and December 2024 had about a Program Expenses $2,204 +$18,888 surge (thanks to the year-end grant payouts and strong service revenue). Despite the volatility in between, overall cash on hand increased by only ~$2,615 over the Office & Administration $1,038 year. The organization ended March 2025 with approximately $32,512 in cash across all accounts, up from around $29.9K a year prior. This modest net increase in cash, despite significant revenue growth, reflects that surpluses from big inflows were largely spent Personal Expenses $797
down in investments in infrastructure to avoid even higher operating costs in subsequent months. In other words, the nonprofit was often living close to its means — periods of Professional Services $810 surplus were short-lived as funds were used to assure future growth while continuing to pay operating costs.

# Travel & Transportation $344

Liquidity Position (End of 2024) Marketing & Advertising $102 As of March 31, 2025, the cash balance of ~$32.5K provides a limited cushion relative to monthly expenses. Given that March 2025 expenses were in the mid-$30K range, the cash . bnly about one month’s worth of expenses. This thin reserve pote ReCUn DOLE Pe ses ella situation going into FY2025 — the organization does not have a large buffer if revenues dip or expenses spike. Maintaining and building liquidity will be critical to sustain operations, absent further large infusions of cash.

# 1 - Status Quo Forecast

After April's deficit, Anything Helps begins May 2025 with approximately $27,700 in cash on hand. Under a status quo forecast using current Q1 2025 run rates (no changes to income or expenses), the organization would continue to run a monthly operating deficit. Projected monthly income remains about $27,700, and monthly expenses remain about $32,500, resulting in an ongoing shortfall of roughly $4,800 each month. The table below summarizes the base case projections for May and June 2025:

# 2. Adjustment Forecast

To improve short-term viability, an adjusted scenario applies proactive changes starting in May 2025. We assume that April 2025 was unchanged so that beginning cash on May 1 is still $27,700. From May onward, however, the organization assumes an increase of revenue and a reduction of expenses each month. These changes, applied to both May and June, are estimated as follows:

Personal Expenses -100% Representative of Mikes inability to access company funds
These adjustments reflect a strategic reallocation of resources. The plan is to spend more on core mission delivery (staff and contractors) to drive revenue growth, while trimming or eliminating discretionary costs elsewhere. Notably, even with the boosts to payroll and contractor fees, several support and overhead expenses are reduced substantially, so the total monthly expenses increase only slightly under this scenario.
The projected outcome for each month (May and June 2025) under the adjusted scenario is nearly break-even:
xpenses would be about $35,080, which is only
vel ($32,500) despite the major program/staff rises by about $7,000 per month (to $34,670). This itional revenue more than covers the modest expense increases.
