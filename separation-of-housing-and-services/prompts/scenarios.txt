# Separation Of Housing &

Services
To ensure clients can maintain stable housing regardless of their participation in services, we uphold a strict separation between housing management and supportive services. This division is essential to fostering non-coercive, psychologically safe relationships built on mutual trust and respect. When support is needed, providers remain approachable and responsiveâ€”never perceived as enforcers or gatekeepers to housing.
Definitions
Community-Based: Services designed, delivered, and managed within the local community, tailored to meet the specific needs and preferences of clients. These services aim to be accessible, culturally relevant, and integrated into daily life, fostering a sense of ownership, trust, and support.
On-Site: Refers to services, programs, or initiatives provided directly where clients live, such as within the same building or housing complex. These services are delivered by staff stationed at the same site, often in offices within the residential facility.
Procedures Advocacy
e Case managers should attend lease signings when possible to ensure tenancy is not conditioned on service participation.

# Privacy Protections

e Client units must remain private; no monitoring equipment may be installed inside. e Aconfidential, neutral space must be available for service delivery, separate from property staff.
Coordination
e Communication between housing and service teams should be scheduled and structured, not blended under shared management. e Client progress is discussed in joint meetings while maintaining each party's distinct responsibilities.

# Voluntary Service Engagement

e Clients are not required to engage in services to retain housing. Tenancy is governed solely by lease agreements, not by service participation.

# Role Separation

e Case managers do not handle rent, lease enforcement, or eviction-related tasks. e Property managers do not deliver case management, treatment, or support services. e These functions are to be performed by different legal entities or staff with clearly delineated roles.

# Service Design

e Services should be community-based whenever possible. e lf services are delivered on-site, they must preserve client privacy and independence, avoiding any sense of surveillance or coercion.
Example: If a client stops attending meetings or has a mental health crisis, their housing remains secure unless they violate lease terms (e.g., pose a safety risk). Property management is only notified if service issues directly impact tenancy. Support remains available voluntarily.
