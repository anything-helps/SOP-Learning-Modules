# Programmatic Principles

Purpose
To ensure that clients are supported in achieving long-term stability through access to integrated housing and community resources within the broader community in which they live, fostering social inclusion, reducing stigma, and promoting healthy social behavior.
Definitions
Community Integration: The process of facilitating the participation of individuals in the social, cultural, economic, and political life of the community.
Scattered-Site Housing: Housing units distributed throughout various neighborhoods rather than concentrated in a single building or area, aimed at promoting community integration.
PSH Buildings: Permanent Supportive Housing buildings that provide affordable housing with on-site supportive services.
Procedures Re-establish Healthy Social Norms
Conduct a comprehensive assessment of each client's integration needs and preferences, considering factors such as proximity to social supports, access to community resources, and engagement in activities of interest. Respect clientsâ€™ preferences for location and household composition to ensure agency and foster a supportive environment. Facilitate introductions to neighbors to help clients build a sense of community. Accompany clients to local stores, resources, and community events to encourage community participation. Provide supportive services in a manner that promotes independence and integration, not coercion and dependency. Offer to take public transportation with clients to familiarize them with routes to community resources.

# Partnership And Collaboration

Develop partnerships with local organizations, community groups, and service providers to enhance the support network for clients. Collaborate with stakeholders to create opportunities for clients to participate in community activities and access resources.

# Monitoring And Adjustment

Regularly review and adjust housing placements and support plans based on client feedback and care needs. Conduct three- and six- month follow-up assessments to ensure clients continue to feel integrated and supported in their communities.
